# TODO List for Fixing Traffic Control System

- [x] Rename folder from Trafic_cntrol_system to Traffic_control_system
- [x] Rename higway_signal.py to highway_signal.py
- [x] Fix base_signal.py: Change "vechile_count" to "vehicle_count", "Trafic" to "Traffic", "single_type(slef)" to "signal_type(self)"
- [x] Fix city_signal.py: Change "vechile_count" to "vehicle_count", "Calculting" to "Calculating", "single_type" to "signal_type"
- [x] Fix highway_signal.py: Change "vechile_count" to "vehicle_count", "Calculting" to "Calculating", "single_type" to "signal_type", "higway" to "highway"
- [x] Fix controller.py: Change "startd" to "started", "single_type()" to "signal_type()"
- [x] Fix app.py: Change "vechiles" to "vehicles", "higway_signal" to "highway_signal", update imports
- [x] Test the simulation
- [x] Ensure logging works
